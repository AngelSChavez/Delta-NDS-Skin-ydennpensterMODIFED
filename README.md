# Delta-NDS-Skin-ydennpensterMODIFED

This is a NDS Skin for Delta Emulator for iOS which is only compatible with iPhone X and above.
The skin was originally made by ydennpenster (https://gbatemp.net/threads/some-more-modified-drastic-backgrounds-dark-mode.585295/)
I just took the screenshots and crudely photoshopped them to be compatible on my iPhone and wrote a .json file for it to work on Delta Emulator.
